## About senter

I'm a PhD student with a focus on neurocomputing and graph neural networks. I bought my first mechanical keyboard, a Cooler Master QuickFire XT, on 05/24/2014 when I was working as an RA in the Institute of Psychology, CAS. My work has nothing to do with this hobby except that I worked on an oscillator neural network (ONN) model that utilized the same mechanism as the crystal oscillators on the keyboard PCBs. Keyboard has now become a part of my life. Every year I look back, I always can realize how much knowledge I've got during that year and how ignorant I was in the previous year.
