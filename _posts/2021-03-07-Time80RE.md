## Keyboard information

- Plate file: [MX Version]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_MX_split.dxf), [ALPS Version (only compatible with XDA ALPS caps)]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_ALPS_XDA.dxf)


## Build guide

- Step 1: Install the stabilizers first. Clip, lube, and band-aid mod your stabilizers if necessary.

- Step 2: (Optional) Add the rubber middle sheet on top of the PCB. Adding the sheet will change the feel and sound of the switches, but not necessarily the way you want. The sheet shrinks after it's cut so you need to stretch it to make it fit.

- Step 3: Solder or insert the switches depending on which version of the PCB you use. If you're using the sheet, it's easies to solder/insert the switches on four corners first.

- Step 4: Mount the plate to the top case. The plate can be installed/removed only when the keycaps are off.

- Step 5: Install all the screws and keycaps.

- Step 6: Flash the [Time80RE_hs_via.hex file]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_hs_via.hex) for your hotswappable PCB or [Time80RE_solder_via.hex file]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_solder_via.hex) for your solder version PCB using [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases). Download [VIA](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/). If VIA doesn't recognize your keyboard, import keymap files  [Time80RE_hs_via.json]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_hs_via.json) (for hotswappable PCB) or [Time80RE_solder_via.json]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Time80RE_solder_via.json) (for solder PCB).
