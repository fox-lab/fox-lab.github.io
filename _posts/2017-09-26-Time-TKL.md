Hi all, Senter here. After our 1st project Orange TKL ended, now I'm presenting to you our 2nd design which is also a TKL but with a different concept.

Here are the renders for the current design:

![3]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/Time3.jpg)

![4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/Time4.jpg)

We call it Time TKL.

The basic idea is that we want to design a case with complex structures.

All the parts will be made by high quality CNC aluminum.
