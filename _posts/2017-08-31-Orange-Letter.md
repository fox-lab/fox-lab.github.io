Hi all,

Senter here. All packages have been send out and some people have already received their boards.

This is the first time we host a group buy for keyboards on Geekhack. 40 kits were sold to 37 customers. Thank you all for joining this GB. Thank you for putting your trust on an inexperienced team. I hope you will like the keyboard.

There are some experiences I'd like to share with you.

- First, we didn't design the google form very reasonable and as a result it took me a lot of time to communicate with some of you to confirm the information.
- Second, I didn't think over about the options. As a result, there were too many options to make. Three layouts and with/without nameplates, that's 6 types of cases for just 40 kits. We also offered too many color options which seriously increased our and the factory's workload. You know it's much more expensive to make 40 different cases than 40 same cases. I negotiated with the factory many times to make it happen.
- I learnt a lot about your demands. As many people suggested, we changed the design of the seam in the middle of two pieces, changed the suitcase, added another option for the plate, and so on.
- There are also some requests we didn't make true, like ALPS plate/pcb, split backspace.

I really learnt a lot from this group buy. I believe we can do better the next time.

There're also several things we didn't make perfect.

- We didn't print numbers on the nameplate of founder editions. They were printed Orange in place. We didn't make it right because the technician was tired with the tons of options of small order.
- For 2 or 3 plates we didn't make the color right. The fault is on our side that the packing people told me that after the packages were send out.
- It took us 10 days to examine all the 40 boards. We checked the packages carefully but I'm still not 100 percent sure all the boards are perfect.

If you find the kits have any problems you can't accept, the ones I mentioned or not, please feel free to contact me.

I won't call our first GB is a successful one since there are some known problems. I'm really sorry to those whom were affected. I promise I did my best to make everything right but I failed.

Thank you again for joining our first GB. We will make it better the next time.

Regards,

Senter
